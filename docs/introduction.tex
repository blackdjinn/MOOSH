\chapter{Introduction}
Basically, this is an attempt to create a text-based multiplayer RPG server.
There are a number of reasonable ones, but they were designed in the adolesence of the Internet before GUIs and the Web were universal. 

What we want to do here is take the basic concepts and update them to use the last 20-some years of innovations and progress.
To this end, we are assuming an RDBMS as backing store, using a modern language (Ada) for development and taking advantage of multithreading and the other features of modern computing devices.
